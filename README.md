Any fool can come up with an idea - and many fools do. In a connected world it is easy to find co-founders, create websites, get prototypes built etc. One thing is difficult - getting traction.

But there is a much more important thing to think about first.

There is a perfect example of this in the comedy series Silicon Valley. Richard is a mathematician with a really, really clever idea. He gets backing and launches it, winning Tech Crunch Disrupt.

Someone says to him "This will be mega. You'll be CEO of a billion dollar company with 30,000 staff and offices all over the world."

Richard looks appalled. He is a maths geek who likes to solve puzzles. He doesn't want to run companies, talk at conferences all over the world (he puked up just thinking of his talk for this one) or manage people.

So the first step is to look deeply at yourself. What is the one thing you can do better than anybody else in the world. The world - not just your circle of friends or your neighbourhood.

And what really really interests you and gets you excited - makes you stay up until 3 in the morning, drives you to make connections with people you don't know, is so important it doesn't matter how much you spend to make it happen.

Hopefully desire and capability are related. That way you spend all your waking hours thinking about things you are good at.

Then think about the things you are bad at. And the things you hate. Hopefully also connected. But the question is how are you going to do those things? You can find a co-founder, or you can set up systems to make them easier. But beware - they are the things which will sink the company.

Now think of your own mindset.  Douglas Adams encapsulated this...
“We’re not obsessed by anything you see. And that’s the deciding factor. We can't win against obsession. They care, we don't. They win.”
Ford Prefect

If you don't care - really care - someone will always beat you who cares more. If a comfy house or money in the bank is what you are doing this for, that's not good enough.

And how do you work when things go wrong, badly wrong. Do you dig in and try twice as hard, do you shut out the world or do you give up. Because if it is either of the latter two, don't start a company.

My answer is simple - the first step in a startup - before the idea - is know yourself. Work out how to maximise the good bits, cover the bad bits and how much it means to you for this to work.
